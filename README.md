# SIGBREAK
SIGBREAK is a console-based timer that helps you stay focused and productive by
allowing you to balance the time you work and take breaks. It is based on the
[Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), but
unlike traditional Pomodoro timers, SIGBREAK doesn't interrupt your work
sessions with fixed breaks. Instead, it lets you switch between work and
break modes freely, while still ensuring that you take breaks for at least a
fraction of the time you've worked.

## Usage
Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/). Then simply run `python
sigbreak.py` in your favorite terminal (tested on
[rxvt-unicode](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)).
